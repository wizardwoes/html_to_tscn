        content="Reality TV, karaoke, sampling, blogs: how are these things to be interpreted? Something is not interesting unless its conditions of interpretation are fundamentally ambiguous. So let’s take blogs as an example. Blogs are, without a double, responsible for new hypomnesiac practices in the sense in which I discussed Foucault’s analyses of hupomnēmata in Disbelief and Discredit 1. They also immediately became instruments of communication, for businesses and politicians, and, especially, for people seeking elected office.">

                    <p>This is a transitional point of view, the result of a situation in which theory
                        is still not sufficiently removed from practice – not sufficiently specialised –
                        to be able to live a completely separate, independent life. Practical people will
                        always be ‘naïve realists’, i.e. they accept that objects are precisely as they are
                        seen, perceived, and, in general, apprehended. The fetishism of naïve realism
                        consists in that it considers the object to exist in such a form completely independently of any
                        human practice. The naïve realist supposes that the object <em>in
                            itself</em> is, for example, ‘quadrangular’, ‘two yards long’, ‘weighing three pounds’,
                        and does not understand that all these ‘properties’ can in no way belong to
                        the object ‘in itself’. Humanity, in its labour experience over millennia, had
                        to work out methods of comparing and defining forms, measurement, and
                        weight, in order to make ‘quadrangles’, ‘yards’, ‘pounds’, etc. possible. In nature
                        itself – in the instances of elemental resistance which labouring effort comes
                        up against – there are no such things, nor can there be. They are the result
                        of the activity of humanity in overcoming, changing, forming, and organising
                        these resistances. In the hands of fetishists – theoreticians who lock themselves
                        up in their studies and whose narrow specialties have almost nothing to do
                        with the resistance of material objects – this distortion develops further. Their
                        sense of isolation from material objects and their sense of the ‘independence’
                        of material objects are considerably deeper. They believe that such objects not
                        only exist independently from themselves but that they are so independent
                        as to be completely inaccessible to their minds; only their ‘outward appearance’ is accessible –
                        masks which they put on before the observer. And a feeling
                        of their individual powerlessness – their personal passivity in relation to the
                        external world – reinforces in them the conviction that this ‘outward appearance’ is entirely
                        the result of <em>the object’s</em> action on them, that they themselves
                        only ‘apprehend’ that action.</p>

                    <p>The violence and insecurity in which we live—as much as they
                        are exploited to the point of fantasy, or even deliberately manipulated—engage
                        above all a question of narcissism, and result from
                        a process of loss of individuation. It is a matter of narcissism in
                        the sense of someone like Richard Durn, assassin of a <em>we</em>—to assassinate members of a
                        municipal council, the official representatives of a <em>we</em>, is to assassinate a
                        <em>we</em>—who suffered
                        terribly from not existing, from not having, he said, a “feeling of existing.” When
                        he looked in the mirror he saw only an immense nothing. This
                        was revealed by the publication of his personal diary in <em>Le Monde</em>.
                        Durn affirmed that he had a need to “do evil at least once in his
                        life, to have the feeling of existing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Richard Durn suffered from a <em>structural privation of his primordial narcissistic
                            capacities</em>.
                        I call “primordial narcissism” that structure of the psyche which is indispensable for
                        functioning,
                        that part of self-love which can sometimes become pathological,
                        but without which any capacity for love would be impossible. Freud speaks of primary narcissism,
                        but that is not what I am referring to.
                        Primary narcissism designates infantile self-love, a precocious phase of
                        sexuality. Freud also speaks of secondary narcissism, which survives
                        into adulthood, but this is still not primordial narcissism, which is
                        without doubt closer to what Lacan calls the “mirror phase.</p>
                    <p>Now, there is a primordial narcissism <em>of the we just as there is of
                            the I</em>: for the narcissism of my <em>I</em> to function,
                        there must be a narcissism of the <em>we</em> onto which it can project itself. Richard Durn,
                        failing to develop his narcissism, saw in the municipal council the
                        reality of an alterity that made him suffer, that did not return to
                        him any image, and he massacred it.</p>
